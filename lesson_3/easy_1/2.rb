# Question 2

=begin
! is used to as to indicate 'not'. Also to force boolean results.
It is also used to indicate a mutating method.
? is used in the ternary operator, as an indication that something
returns true or false, or that the output following is dependent on 
whether something is truthy or falsy.

1. != means 'not equal to'. Used to check if two values are unequal.
2. !user_name would return true if user_name was falsy (false or nil).
   returns opposite of having !! in front.
3. The ! in words.uniq! shows that words is going to be mutated.
4. ? before something is only done in ternary operators right?
5. ? after something usually is a convention that means that something is 
   returning a boolean.
6. !! as in !!user_name converts the user_name into a boolean.
