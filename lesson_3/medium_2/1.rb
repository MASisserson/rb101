Concluding thoughts:
I was right about variables inside the block being nonexistant outside the block.
Assigning new variables to old variables and old variable object_ids doesn't change the object_ids for any of the involved variables.
I kept getting this part wrong though:
Apparently the .times loop can reassign outside variables permanently.
